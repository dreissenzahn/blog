<h3 id="linked-list">Linked List</h3>

<p>
  A linked list is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes that collectively form a sequence. Each node contains a reference to an element of the list and one or more other nodes in the sequence. The first node is called the head and the last node is called the tail.

<h4 id="singly-linked-list">Singly Linked List</h4>

<p>
  In a singly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence and a reference to an element of the list. The next reference of the tail points to null.

<h4 id="doubly-linked-list">Doubly Linked List</h4>

<p>
  In a doubly linked list, each node contains a reference to the previous node in the sequence, a reference to the next node in the sequence and a reference to an element of the list. The previous reference of the head node and the next reference of the tail point to null.

<h4 id="circularly-linked-list">Circularly Linked List</h4>

<p>
  In a circularly linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence and a reference to an element of the list. The next reference of the tail points to the head.

<h4 id="complexity-analysis">Complexity Analysis</h4>

<p>
  Unlike an array, a linked list does not provide constant time access to a particular "index" within the list. If you'd like to find the K-th element in the list, you will need to iterate through K elements. The benefit of a linked list is that you can add and remove items from the beginning of the list in constant time.
