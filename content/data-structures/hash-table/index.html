<h3 id="introduction">Maps</h3>

<p>
	A map is an abstract data type designed to efficiently store and retrieve values based upon a uniquely identifying search key for each. Specifically, a map stores key-value pairs (k,v) which we call entries where k is the key and v is its corresponding value. Keys are required to be unique so that the association of keys to values defines a mapping.

	Maps are also known as associative arrays, because the entryâ€™s key serves somewhat like an index into the map, in that it assists the map in efficiently locating the associated entry. However, unlike a standard array, a key of a map need not be numeric, and is does not directly designate a position within the structure.
