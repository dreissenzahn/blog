<p>
  Breadth-first search is an algorithm for traversing a graph. Given a graph and a source vertex, breadth-first search explores the graph to discover every vertex that is reachable from the source vertex. It proceeds by exploring all of the adjacent vertices at the present depth prior to moving on to the vertices at the next depth level. Breadth-first search can also be used to find the shortest path between two vertices.

<h3 id="traversal">Traversal</h3>

<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize an empty queue.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark the source vertex as visited and enqueue it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dequeue a vertex and consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a vertex adjacent to the dequeued vertex has not been visited then mark it as visited and enqueue it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 3-4 until the queue is empty.
  </li>
</ol>

  <li>
    Initialize an empty queue.

  <li>
    Mark the source vertex as visited and enqueue it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Dequeue a vertex and consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a vertex adjacent to the dequeued vertex has not been visited then check if it is the target vertex. If it is then return successfully. Otherwise, mark it as visited and enqueue it.

    Repeat steps 3-4 until the queue is empty.

<h3 id="shortest-path">Shortest Path</h3>

<p>
  Breadth-first search can be used to find the shortest path between two vertices provided all the weights in the graph are one.
