<p>
  In computer science, radix sort is a non-comparative sorting algorithm. It avoids comparison by creating and distributing elements into buckets according to their radix. For elements with more than one significant digit, this bucketing process is repeated for each digit, while preserving the ordering of the prior step, until all digits have been considered.

  Radix sort only works when sorting numbers with a fixed number of digits. It won't work for arbitrarily-large numbers.

<h4>Procedure</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Find the largest element in the array and determine the number of digits in this largest element.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use any stable sorting technique to sort the elements based on the unit place digits.
  </li>
  <li>
    Then sort the elements based on digits at tens place.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue this process for each of number of digits in the largest element.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  Any stable sorting algorithm â†´ can be used here. In practice, counting sort works well, since the digits can only take on a small number of values (i.e.: 0 - 9 for base-10 numbers; 0 - 1 for base-2 numbers).

  Notice how whenever there was a tie in the tens place the number with a lower ones digit came first. This is why using a stable sorting algorithm is important. It means that if there's a tie on the current digit we'll fall back to how the numbers were ordered based on the digits we already sorted.

1. Find out the maximum element (let it be max) from the given array.
2. Initialize an array of length max+1 with all elements 0. This array is used for storing the count of the elements in the array.
3. Store the count of each element at their respective index in count array.
4. Store cumulative sum of the elements of the count array. It helps in placing the elements into the correct index of the sorted array.
5. Find the index of each element of the original array in the count array. This gives the cumulative count. Place the element at the index calculated as shown in figure below.
6. After placing each element at its correct position, decrease its count by one.

  <tr>
    <td>Worst case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Best case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Average case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space</td>
    <td>\(O(n)\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
