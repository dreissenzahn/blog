<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  Depth-first search is an algorithm for traversing or searching a graph. From the starting node, the algorithm explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.
</p>


<h3 id="procedure">Procedure</h3>

The DFS algorithm is a recursive algorithm that uses the idea of backtracking. It involves exhaustive searches of all the nodes by going ahead, if possible, else by backtracking.

Here, the word backtrack means that when you are moving forward and there are no more nodes along the current path, you move backwards on the same path to find nodes to traverse. All the nodes will be visited on the current path till all the unvisited nodes have been traversed after which the next path will be selected.


<h3 class="connected-components"></h3>

A graph is said to be disconnected if it is not connected, i.e. if two nodes exist in the graph such that there is no edge in between those nodes. In an undirected graph, a connected component is a set of vertices in a graph that are linked to each other by paths.

Consider the example given in the diagram. Graph G is a disconnected graph and has the following 3 connected components.

First connected component is 1 -> 2 -> 3 as they are linked to each other
Second connected component 4 -> 5
Third connected component is vertex 6

In DFS, if we start from a start node it will mark all the nodes connected to the start node as visited. Therefore, if we choose any node in a connected component and run DFS on that node it will mark the whole connected component as visited.

For the following graph:

a depth-first search starting at A, assuming that the left edges in the shown graph are chosen before right edges, and assuming the search remembers previously visited nodes and will not repeat them (since this is a small graph), will visit the nodes in the following order: A, B, D, F, E, C, G.
