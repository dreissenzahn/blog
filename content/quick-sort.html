<p>
  Quicksort is a sorting algorithm that works by selecting a pivot element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively. This can be done in-place, requiring small additional amounts of memory to perform the sorting.
</p>


<h4>Procedure</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Choose the leftmost element as the pivot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partition the array so that elements less than the pivot come before it and elements larger than the pivot come after it.
  </li>
  <li>
    Recursively apply the above steps to the sub-array of smaller elements and separately to the sub-array of larger elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue until a sub-array of length one or zero is encountered.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  To partition the array elements using the Hoare partition scheme we proceed as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Place a left pointer at the leftmost index of the array after the pivot and a right pointer at the rightmost index of the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the left pointer to the right until it reaches an element larger than (or equal to) the pivot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the right pointer to the left until it reaches an element smaller than (or equal to) the pivot.
  </li>
  <li>
    Swap the element at the left pointer with the element at the right pointer.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 2-4 until the pointers cross each other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Move the pivot to its correct position by swapping it with the element at the right pointer.
  </li>
</ol>


<h4>Complexity</h4>

    <td>Worst case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n^2)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Best case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n \log n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Average case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n \log n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space</td>
    <td>\(O(\log n)\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
