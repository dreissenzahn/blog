	That name ar does not have any space allocated to it; it's like a constant, a number. So, you can't reverse that assignment

	ar = ar_p ;     // THIS WON'T WORK
	
	for the same reason you couldn't say

	1000 = ar_p ;   // THIS WON'T WORK EITHER

	ie, you can't change the value of 1000. (Back in early versions of FORTRAN, this trick would work, for complicated reasons. It was a mistake. You've never lived until you've tried to debug a program in which the value of "2" is 3.)
