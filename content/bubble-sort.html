<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  A sorting algorithm is an algorithm that puts elements of a list in a certain order.

<h3 id="bubble-sort">Bubble Sort</h3>

<p>
  Bubble sort, sometimes referred to as sinking sort, is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted. The algorithm, which is a comparison sort, is named for the way smaller or larger elements "bubble" to the top of the list.
</p>


<h4>Procedure</h4>

<ol>
  <li>
    Start at the first index of the array.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare the first and second elements. If the first element is larger than the second element then swap the elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Compare the second and third elements. If the second element is larger than the third element then swap the elements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to compare elements in this manner until the last unsorted element is reached.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the above process. In each iteration, the largest element among the unsorted elements is placed at the end.
  </li>
  <li>
    The array is sorted when all the unsorted elements are placed at their correct positions.
  </li>
</ol>


<h4>Example</h4>

<p>
  In the following example we sort the array with values \(5, 3, 1, 2, 6, 4\):

<h4>Complexity</h4>

  <tr>
    <td>Worst case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n^2)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Best case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Average case time</td>
    <td>\(O(n^2)\)</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Space</td>
    <td>\(O(1)\)</td>
  </tr>
</table>
