<h3 id="introduction">Introduction</h3>

<p>
  Newscast is a gossip protocol proposed by Jelasity et al. for communication in large-scale distributed systems. It provides both membership management and information dissemination services using the same gossip protocol. Agents can join and leave the network at virtually no cost at all, and without affecting the information-dissemination properties of the protocol.
</p>


<h3 id="news-agencies">Agents and Agencies</h3>

<p>
  The two primary components of the newscast model are a collective of <i>agents</i> and a <i>news agency</i>. The agents perform computations that result in application specific news. The news agency regularly asks all agents for news using a <code>getNews()</code> callback and also provides each agent with news about the other agents by means of the <code>newsUpdate(news[])</code> callback.

<h3 id="resources">Correspondents</h3>

<p>
  Each agent has an associated <i>correspondent</i> running on the same machine. These correspondents jointly form the distributed implementation of the news agency. Each correspondent maintains a fixed-sized cache of \(c\) cache entries where \(c\) is a parameter. Correspondents are passed news from agents in the form of <i>news items</i> consisting of an agent identifier and the application specific news. The correspondent adds these news items to its cache along with the current timestamp and the correspondent's network address.

<h3 id="resources">Cache Exchanges</h3>

<p>
  Correspondents regularly exchange caches. Each correspondent executes the following five steps once every <i>refresh interval</i> \(\Delta t\):
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Request a fresh news item from the local agent by calling <code>getNews()</code> and add the item to the cache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Randomly select a peer correspondent by considering the network address of other available correspondents as found in the cache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Send all cache entries to the selected peer and, in turn, receive all the peer's cache entries. Merge the received entries into the local cache.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pass the received cache entries from the peer agent to the local agent by calling <code>newsUpdate()</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    The correspondent now has \(2c\) cache entries and so it throws away the \(c\) oldest ones.
  </li>
</ol>

<p>
  We assume that the communication time between two correspondents is negligible in comparison to \(\Delta T\) (which is generally in the order of minutes). If \(\Delta T\) is chosen to be so small that this assumption is violated then newscast will not be able to work correctly since in each cycle at least one communication has to  be completed according to the protocol.
</p>


<h3 id="resources">Merging Caches</h3>

<p>  
  When a correspondent \(A\) passes its cache to \(B\), it also sends along its current local time, \(T_A\). When \(B\) receives the cache entries, it adjusts the timestamp of each entry with a value \(T_A - T_B\). This effectively normalizes the time of each new entry to those already cached. As such, newscast does not require that the clocks of correspondents are synchronized as only the timestamps of news items in a single cache need to be mutually consistent.
