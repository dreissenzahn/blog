<!-- 
  Graph traversal refers to the process of exploring each vertex in a graph. Specifically, given an undirected or directed graph \(G = (V, E)\) and a source vertex \(s \in V\), we identify those vertices reachable from \(s\).
    
  Graph traversal refers to the process of visiting each vertex in a graph. Given a graph and a source vertex a graph traversal algorithm explores the graph to discover every vertex that is reachable from the source vertex.

  The generic algorithm systematically finds all the reachable vertices, taking care to avoid exploring anything twice.
 -->
 

<h3 id="procedure">Traversal</h3>

<p>
  Depth-first search starts from a source vertex and repeatedly explores an unvisited vertex adjacent to the current vertex. This proceeds until the algorithm cannot find such an unexplored vertex at which point it backtracks along previously visited vertices until it finds an unvisited vertex to explore. It then continues down this new path until it encounters another dead-end at which point it backtracks. This continues until the algorithm backtracks past the source vertex.
</p>

<!-- 
  Depth-first search is perhaps even more important. DFS employs a more aggressive strategy for exploring a graph, very much in the spirit of how you might explore a maze, going as deeply as you can and backtracking only when absolutely necessary.

  If breadth-first search is the cautious and tentative exploration strategy, depth-first search is its more aggressive cousin, always exploring from the most recently discovered vertex and backtracking only when necessary (like exploring a maze).

<p>
  Depth-first search proceeds as follows:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    Initialize an empty stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Mark the source vertex as visited and push it onto the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pop a vertex off the stack and consider each of its adjacent vertices.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a vertex adjacent to the popped vertex has not been visited then mark it as visited and push it onto the stack.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat steps 3-4 until the stack is empty.
  </li>
</ol>

<h3 class="complexity">Complexity</h3>

<p>
  Both breath-first search and depth-first search have worst-case performance of \(O(|V| + |E|)\) and worst-case space complexity of \(O(|V|)\).
</p>

<!-- 
  Graph traversal may require that some vertices be visited more than once, since it is not necessarily known before transitioning to a vertex that it has already been explored.

  Thus, it is usually necessary to remember which vertices have already been explored by the algorithm, so that vertices are revisited as infrequently as possible (or in the worst case, to prevent the traversal from continuing indefinitely).
