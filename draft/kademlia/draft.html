  When computing the distance, it is important to use a metric that satisfies certain desirable properties. For instance, consider the simplified 4-bit identifier space in <i>figure 2</i>. If we were to the Euclidean distance \(d(x,y) = |x-y|\), then the distance between Key 2 and Node A would be \(|5-3|=2\). However, the distance between Key 2 and Node B would also be \(|5-7|=2\). Addressing these kinds of ambiguities would introduce undesirable complexity.
